# Red Badger Blog Template for Squarespace

Minimalistic Red Badger branded template. Universal. Works with and without JavaScript on the client.

## Setup

```
npm install
make start
```

## Issue Tracking

Please log any issues at https://github.com/redbadger/website-honestly/issues prepending `[Blog]` to the issue title.

## Supported post elements

All Squarespace block elements are tested and should work as expected. You will need JS enabled client for some of the interactive elements.

## Deployment

Squarespace provides us with git endpoint. Deployment is happening by pushing current master branch to that endpoint. You will need your Squarespace admin credentials for that.

Setup one of the git remotes to `https://redbadger-blog.squarespace.com/template.git`
